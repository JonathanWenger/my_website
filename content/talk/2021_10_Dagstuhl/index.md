title: "ProbNum: Probabilistic Numerics in Python"
event: "Dagstuhl Seminar 21432: Probabilistic Numerical Methods - From Theory to Implementation"
event_url: https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21432
location: Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany
summary: | 
  ProbNum is a Python library that provides probabilistic numerical solvers to a wider audience. In
  the talk, we describe the current state and functionality of ProbNum and highlight some benefits of
  open source collaboration for students and for the community. The second part of the talk contains
  a live demonstration of some of the ProbNum solvers.
