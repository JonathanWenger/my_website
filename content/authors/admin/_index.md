I am a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Tübingen and an IMPRS-IS fellow advised by [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/personen/philipp-hennig/). My research focuses on **numerical methods for machine learning**, in particular [**probabilistic numerics**](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) which interprets numerical methods as learning procedures. I am also closely collaborating with [Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/), in particular [John P. Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/).

<!-- During my master degrees I worked with [Rudolph Triebel](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/triebel) at TUM and [Hedvig Kjellström](https://www.kth.se/profile/hedvig) at KTH on probability calibration. I also got to spend ten months as a visiting graduate student in the group of [Nir Hacohen](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/nir-hacohen) at the Broad Institute developing clustering approaches to transcriptomic time-series. -->

In my free time I love to do sports, in particular any kind of cycling.
