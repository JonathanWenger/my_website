I am a postdoctoral research scientist at [Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) working with [John P. Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/). My research focuses on **numerical methods for machine learning**, in particular [**probabilistic numerics**](http://probabilistic-numerics.org/) which interprets numerical methods as learning procedures. Previously I was a doctoral student in computer science at the University of Tübingen and an IMPRS-IS fellow advised by [Philipp Hennig](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/personen/philipp-hennig/).
